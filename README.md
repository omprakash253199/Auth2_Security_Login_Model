# Auth2_Security_Login_Model
We have built an application, from frontend (Angular) to backend (Spring Boot), which will allow users to register and login account.  This application is secured with JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication and Spring Security.  Then, depending on the role of current User (user, pm or admin), this system will accept what he/she can access.
